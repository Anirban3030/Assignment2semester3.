3. Turn every item of a list into its square.
4. Concatenate two lists in the following order.
5. Iterate both lists simultaneously.
6. Remove empty strings from the list of strings. 
7.Add new item to list after a specified item. 
8.Extend nested list by adding the sublist. 
9.Replace list’s item with new value if found
10. Remove all occurrences of a specific item from a list.

Tuples: 
1. Reverse the tuple.
2. Access value 20 from the tuple.
3. Create a tuple with single item 10.
4. Unpack the tuple into 4 variables.
5. Swap two tuples in Python.
6. Copy specific elements from one tuple to a new tuple.
7. Modify the tuple.
8. Sort a tuple of tuples by 2nd item.

elements.
